\title{Fpa from Flim}
\usage{
Fpa(Flim, sigmaF)
}
\arguments{
\item{Flim}{the value of the Flim reference point.}

\item{sigmaF}{the estimation uncertainty in F (standard error of logF in the
terminal year).}
}
\value{
Value of Fpa.
}
\description{
Calculate the value of Fpa from Flim and sigmaF.
}
\note{
The purpose of PA reference points is to apply a precautionary approach in
fisheries management.

By comparing the current F to Fpa, one can answer the question: are we at
least 95\% sure that F is below Flim, given the estimation uncertainty?

The ICES (2017) technical guidelines define Fpa as:

\deqn{F_\mathrm{pa} = F_\mathrm{lim} \exp(-1.645\sigma_F)}{
      Fpa = Flim * exp(-1.645*sigmaF)}

The \code{Fpa} function can also be used to calculate reference points based
on harvest rate: Hpa from Hlim and sigmaH.
